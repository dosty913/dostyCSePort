## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dosty913/dostyCSePort/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dosty913/dostyCSePort/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### WORK IN PROGRESS

### Self-Assessment 

Before starting my education at SNHU, I had very little experience in the computer science field. I had always had an interest in the area but never really explored it more than simple things at home tinkering with my computer, this program has made my wish of knowledge in this field more of a reality. I kind of like that I started from nothing coming into the program, it seemed like I was in some way behind most of the time and I felt that it kind of game me drive to try and keep up more maybe. Learning about all of the different languages and how they have progressed in a lot of ways has tought me the value of improvement and innovation. This makes me think of the valuable and important standards within this field, some of which are flexibilitiy and resourcefullness, without such things it would take much longer to improve and progress. Learning about databases, structures, algorithms has opened my mind to how things work in this digital world I find myself thinking about how an application or feature of a website is setup or works. 

### Team Collaboration:
In todays world especially it is very useful to be able to work remotely when needed, this is one of the great aspects of computer science as a whole. As long as we have access to the internet and a computer we can work from home and given the right setup we can collaborate with teamates to build a large project of any kind. There will always be security risks when working exclusively online, but as I have learned throughout this program as long as you take the proper steps to ensure only those who require access to your project will be able to view/edit it. Being able to link up with your teamates and their portions of the code/project, is amazing helpful with the right environment as you can pull down their section and begin to tie it in to the rest of the project while maintaining the integritiy of the main branch when needed. This is one of the most important aspects I have taken from workikng with a team, paired with proper commenting and any further communication it can hugely streamline building a large project by dividiing workload and responsibility. 

### Communicating with Customers:
One of the biggest components of a software development cycle that I have learned in this program would most definetely be commnunication. Just as important as communicating with a team you are working with, is simply good commnunication with the customer so as to ensure satisfaction. As customers will know generally what they want a product to be able to do, they often will not know exactly how they want it implemented. When it comes to certain features or functions, this program has taught me that it is important to save/review/test as often as possible. The same idea goes for communication with the customer, the more they are in the loop with how an important feature they request is coming or exactly how it will actually work, it can save tons of time on the back end trying to redo/modify how it actually works. This will also give the customer a more hands on feel to their projects development, which will be good for both sides of the deal and should ultimately lead to a smoother process. I have also learned that too much hands-on for the customer can also be a bit too much for certain aspects of the team and is why most development strategies suggest a type of lead that will take care of this communication in both directions.

### Data Structures and Algorithms:
This program has done a good job of showcasing the importance of structuring code in such a manner as to ensure effieciency, this coupled with utilizing a proper storage method dependent upon what type of use is required can lead to a much better experience when working on a project. It has also shown the way that a storage method is built can help determine what type or how complex a search algorithm you may need, as it might not be necessary to implement a more complex algorithm if your database isn't very large or is setup in such a way which makes search/sort easy in nature.

### Software Engineering and Databases:
Working through this program has been interesting as it has given opportunity to work with a couple different databases, in which I have had the ability to learn to interact with these databases working out ways of manipulating them as required. This has been a interesting and challenging experience as depening on the database it changes if/how you can manipulate things as you need. I plan to continue to progress in this area as it seems like a very important part of this field in general but also something I plan to move into in my career.

### Security:
This aspect of coding makes a lot of sense to me, only more and more as time goes on and more giant companies have giant data breaches. I also served in the military for quite some time and that has also left a heavy imprint on me in terms of keeping things secure in general. I did learn in this program that many of the major issues and breaches that have occured over time were either simple brute force attacks which bring down a system which creates a vulnerable state or actual social engineering of some sort was used to garner legitimate login credentials from someone within the organization. This tells me that these types of issues are absolutely preventable, with proper planning or prevention techniques and training breaches and leaks can be kept to a minimum.

### Project Inclusion:
The gameplan I had going into this project was to take a dataset we used in CS-260, in which we used a binary search tree to show how efficiency differs based on database type/size and certain types of algorithms. The plan was to utilize this project that began as a C++ product and convert it into a python program, as we did in a similar fashion in another class in this program. The other class utilized a virtual desktop that used Jupyter Notebook to implement a python dashboard setup, for my project in this class I did not have access to this virtual setup any longer so I had to improvise. So in general I utilized parts of two separate projects and had to adjust quite a few aspects of both to make my idea come to life.
